# Smoke Slider <img alt="Logo" src="/icon.png" align="right" height="50">

I crafted this project during my SwiftUI animation exploring the use of ```animation```, ```spritekit particle```.

## Inspiration 💡

The main idea of this source code based on [Smoke Slider](https://dribbble.com/shots/8424211-Smoke-Slider) created by [Aaron Iker](https://dribbble.com/ai).
